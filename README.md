# linear-regression-algorithm

a simple linear regression least squares algorithm implemented by hand without the use of Machine Learning libraries.

the model was trained using a dataset that detailed apartment prices in the Toronto area. 

the model will ask a user to input their own data about a singular apartment and predict a price-point for that apartment,
it will then give you the error margins.
